=======
The **mangos server project** is the work of many awesome people, and contributors
from all over the world, and is the result of quite a few predecessors.

This file contains all the projects and people involved in the project and its'
creation.

History
-------
The roots of *mangos* date back to 2004, many developers were anxious to get
a working server for the [World of Warcraft][1] beta running at that time.

Various projects such as *TeamPython*, *Wow Python* and *WoWd* produced GPL'd
server code, and furthered the development of a few [World of Warcraft][1] servers for the community.

* **2004**: *TeamPython*, *Wow Python* and *WoWd* develop the predecessors for
  *mangos*.
* **2005**: the *MaNGOS project* - an abbreviation for *Massive Network Game
  Object Server* - was founded. The first project website was located at
  http://www.mangosproject.org/ and a couple of other addresses, which are all defunct now. <br />
  The Source code was released
  on [SourceForge][2] using Subversion, and old versions are kept there for
  archival to this day. More recent versions of the older server code are archived at [Mangos Archives][5].
* **2008**: the *MaNGOS project* grew in terms of users and developers,
  and relocated to [github][3]. With the move, the project website changed
  to [getmangos.eu][4].
