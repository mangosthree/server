/**
 * This is the class that takes care of representing a ticket made to the GMs on the server
 * with a question of some sort.
 *
 * The code responsible for taking care of the opcodes coming
 * in can be found in:
 * - \ref WorldSession::SendGMTicketStatusUpdate
 * - \ref WorldSession::SendGMTicketGetTicket
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketGetTicketOpcode
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketUpdateTextOpcode
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketDeleteTicketOpcode
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketCreateOpcode
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketSystemStatusOpcode
 * - \ref WorldSession::HandleGMTicketSurveySubmitOpcode
 * These in their turn will make calls to the \ref GMTicketMgr which will take
 * care of what needs to be done by giving back a \ref GMTicket. The database table interesting
 * in this case is character_ticket in the characaters database.
 *
 * Theres also some handling of tickets in \ref ChatHandler::HandleTicketCommand where
 * you can turn on/off accepting tickets with your current GM char. You can also turn
 * off tickets globally, this will show the client a message about tickets not being
 * available at the moment. The commands that can be used are:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>.ticket on/off</dt>
 * <dd>Turns on/off showing new incoming tickets for you character</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket system_on/off</dt>
 * <dd>Will turn the whole ticket reporting system on/off, ie: if it's off the clients
 * will get a message that the system is unavailable when trying to submit a ticket</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket close $character_name/.ticket close #num_of_ticket</dt>
 * <dd>Will close a ticket for the given character name or the given number of the ticket,
 * this will make the little icon in the top right go away for the player</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket close_survey $character_name/.ticket close_survey #num_of_ticket</dt>
 * <dd>Does the same as .ticket close but instead of just closing it it also asks the \ref Player
 * to answer a survey about how please they were with the experience</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket respond $character_name/.ticket respond #num_of_ticket</dt>
 * <dd>Will respond to a ticket, this will whisper the \ref Player who asked the question and from
 * there on you will have to explain the solution etc. and then close the ticket again.</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket</dt>
 * <dd>Shows the number of currently active tickets</dd>
 * <dt>.ticket $character_name/.ticket #num_of_ticket</dt>
 * <dd>Will show the question and name of the character for the given ticket</dd>
 *
 * \todo Do not remove tickets from db when closing but mark them as solved instead.
 * \todo Log conversations between GM and the player receiving help.
