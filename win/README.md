# EasyBuild
---

**Easy Build is a MaNGOS dependency checker and Cmake helper GUI.**

Run this from the win folder of a MaNGOS repository and it will check all the required libraries are installed and all required submodules are cloned correctly.

This ensures that the build process will find them and build correctly.

It also provides a GUI for the Cmake build options.




For Mangos Three *ONLY* - There is a file that needs to be run to make easybuild work:

Patch_Easybuild_Mangos3.cmd

To remove the patch:

Patch_Easybuild_Mangos3_remove.cmd

Once again, only use the patch files on MangosThree
